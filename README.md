# Cars24_EDA

Exploratory data analysis and feature engineering on a Cars24 dataset of used cars.

### Exploratory data analysis:
The code first loads the data and performs some basic checks on it, such as looking at the shape of the data, the data types of the columns, and some descriptive statistics. The code then creates some visualizations to explore the distributions of the features and to identify any outliers. It calculates the percentage of outliers for selling price and imputes the values. It also analyzes the correlations between the numerical features.

### Feature engineering:
The code then performs some feature engineering to prepare the data for modelling. This includes extracting the make and model from the full name, encoding some of the categorical variables, and scaling the numerical features.
